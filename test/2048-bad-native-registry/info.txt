This is an adaptation of 030-bad-finalizer and 2041-bad-cleaner
to Java 8 Cleaners created indirectly via NativeAllocationRegistry. These
run directly in the ReferenceQueueDaemon. The native finalizer never finishes.
ART is expected to detect this situation and abort the VM (so you should
see a message to that effect in the log output).

We have this test in addition to 2041-bad-cleaner mostly to test that the output
includes useful information in this important case. This is also the only test
of the toString() method provided by that Runnable.
